The Decorator Pattern attaches additional
responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
subclassing for extending functionality.

In this example, we utilize the Decorator Pattern to
make a compile time order for beverages with additional additives
like: Vanilla ice cream, and ice cubes. Then we calculate the total cost
of each order, and display all the contents of that order.
